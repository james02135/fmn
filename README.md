# Fedora Messaging Notifications

[![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fmn/badge/?version=latest)](https://fmn.readthedocs.io/)

FMN is a family of systems to manage end-user notifications triggered by
[fedora-messaging](fedora-messaging.readthedocs.io/). FMN provides a single
place for all applications using Fedora Messaging to notify users of events.
Notifications can be delivered by email, irc, and server-sent events. Users can
configure their notifications for all the applications they use in one place.

FMN is deployed in [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/notifications/).
